# Acrylic Case for Arisutea
アリステア Acrylic Case design formatted ready for Ponoko with the kerf of the switch cutout set to 0.15mm. Case files are updated to reflect changes to the full backspace on switch 59 and have the Arisutea logo engraved on the case. Removed the matte file and adjust the normal so you can use it for either one.

A "boxed" version of the case that I have made is designed to work with some wrist rests that do not have the ortho shape. 

There are now case files for v0.6 PCB that include the indicator LEDs, I have not ordered/tested these but will soon.

These files are a fork from FateNozomi's Arisu case which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-case)
